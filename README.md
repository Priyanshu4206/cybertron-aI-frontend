## Authentication Flow

The application supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Email/Password Registration and Login**
   - User registers with email/password
   - OTP verification is sent to email
   - User verifies OTP to complete registration
   - For login, user enters email/password, then verifies with OTP

2. **Google Authentication**
   - User signs in with Google
   - If new user, they are redirected to complete onboarding
   - If existing user, they are logged in directly

## API Integration

The application uses a GraphQL API for:

- User authentication and management
- Text generation requests
- Chat history storage and retrieval

See the Postman collection for available API endpoints and their usage.
